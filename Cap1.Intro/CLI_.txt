The following properties characterize an Angular component:

• selector: A unique name that is used to identify and declare the component
		inside HTML content. It is used as an HTML tag, just like any native HTML
		element, such as <app-root></app-root>

• templateUrl: The path pointing to an HTML file that contains the HTML
		   content of the component, which is called the template of the component.

• styleUrls: A list of paths where each one points to a stylesheet file containing the
             CSS styles of the component


The decorator of an Angular module defines a set of properties that can be used to
configure the module. The most common ones are as follows:

• declarations: Defines Angular components that are part of the Angular
		    module. Every component that exists in the Angular module must be added to the
                declarations array.
• imports: Defines other Angular modules that contain functionality the Angular
           module needs
